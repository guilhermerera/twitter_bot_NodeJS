# 📖 Study Case
I was looking for a project to practice the creation and deployment of a Node.JS App and I was curious on how to build a Twitter Bot. So I decided to join both and build this. And I mean... dogs.

<br>

# 🤖 What the does the bot do?
The bot fetches the Random Dog API, downloads the image using the link provided by the API. After that, it uploads the picture to Twitter and tweets the picture. After the picture is tweeted, it deletes the picture from the server.
